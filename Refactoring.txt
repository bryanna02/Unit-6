Refatoring is a way to change or alter an existing body of code without changing
the external behavior. Refactoring does little, but can eventually significally
restructure the code. Also it is less likely for serious damage to occur because
it is usually done in small increments. It changes the internal structure, but 
functions the same externally after the "refactoring".
